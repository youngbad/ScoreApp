# ScoreApp

It's a simple application that allows you to download up-to-date data with football results (by web scraping site https://www.football-data.co.uk/), then processes the data to be used in RShiny's dashboard.

The application allows you to track the data of various football leagues including:
- Premier League
- Premier Division,
- Bundesliga,
- Ligue 1
  
The main purpose of the app is to be able to trace the data and catch certain patterns that allow you to notice certain relationships.
